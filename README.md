# Arch installation notes

These installation scripts have been written for my machine using my username
(daryl).  I would not expect them to adapt to other machines as-is, but these
can be used as a starting point for a new Arch Linux installation.

## Installation of a new arch linux system

* Install Arch Linux using installation media
* Run `bash install.sh`

## Post-installation

* Log in as daryl
* Run `bash postinstall.sh`

## Fetching from GitHub

* `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daryl314/arch-install/master/install.sh`
* `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daryl314/arch-install/master/postinstall.sh`
